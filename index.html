			<div class="preex1"><p>Event photography is the professional art of snapping high-quality images during a wide variety of important occasions,
			from personal events like weddings or birthday parties to large public gatherings like corporate events,
			galas, award ceremonies, and music festivals. Wedding photography is often thought of as its own separate genre,
			but a wedding photographerâ€™s skills can be applied to other types of event photography.
			Typically, the goal for any event shoot is to compile a variety of posed and candid photographs of both people and scenery.</p></div>

			<div class="preex2"><p>Portrait photography is about capturing the essence, personality,
			identity and attitude of a person utilizing backgrounds, lighting and posing.
			While this definition may sound simple, portrait photography can be one of the most challenging forms of photography to master.</p></div>

			<div class="preex3"><p>Still life photography is a genre of photography used for the depiction of inanimate subject matter,
			typically a small group of objects. Similar to still life painting, it is the application of photography to the still life artistic style.
			Tabletop photography, product photography, food photography, found object photography etc. are examples of still life photography.</p></div>
